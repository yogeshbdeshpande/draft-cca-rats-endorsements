1.  Introduction

   Arm Confidential Computing Architecture (CCA) Endorsements comprise
   reference values and cryptographic key material that a Verifier needs
   to appraise Attestation Evidence produced by an Arm CCA system
   [I-D.ffm-rats-cca-token].

   This memo defines CCA Endorsements as a profile of the CoRIM data
   model [I-D.ietf-rats-corim].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terms and concepts
   introduced in [I-D.ffm-rats-cca-token] and in Section 4 of [RFC9334].

3.  Arm CCA Endorsements

   The Arm CCA Attester is a layered Attester comprising separate yet
   linked Platform and Realm Attesters.  For the details, see Section 3
   of [I-D.ffm-rats-cca-token].  Appraising Arm CCA Evidence requires
   endorsements for both the Platform and Realm.  This document outlines
   the Platform and Realm endorsements in Section 3.1 and Section 3.2,
   respectively.

3.1.  Arm CCA Platform Endorsements

   There are two types of CCA Platform Endorsements:

   *  Reference Values (Section 3.1.3), i.e., measurements of the CCA
      Platform firmware.

   *  Attestation Verification Keys (Section 3.1.4), i.e., cryptographic
      keys that can be used to verify Evidence produced by the CCA
      Platform, along with the identifiers that link the keys to their
      platform instances.

3.1.1.  Arm CCA Platform Endorsement Profile

   Arm CCA Platform endorsements are carried in one or more CoMIDs
   inside a CoRIM.  The profile attribute in the CoRIM MUST be present
   and MUST be the URI tag:arm.com,2025:cca_platform#1.0.0, as shown in
   Figure 1.

   / corim-map / {
     / corim.profile / 3: [
       32("tag:arm.com,2025:cca_platform#1.0.0")
     ]
     / ... /
   }

          Figure 1: CCA Platform profile version 1, CoRIM profile

3.1.2.  Arm CCA Platform Endorsements linkage to CCA Platform

   Each CCA Platform Endorsement, be it a Reference Value or an
   Attestation Verification Key, is associated with a unique identifier
   known as CCA Platform Implementation ID (see Section 4.4.2 of
   [I-D.ffm-rats-cca-token]).  The Implementation ID uniquely identifies
   a given implementation of a CCA Platform and it is used by the
   Endorser or Reference Value Provider as an anchor to which Reference
   Values and Attestation Verification Keys for a CCA Platform are
   linked.

   To encode an Implementation ID, the tagged-bytes variant of the
   $class-id-type-choice is used, as described in Figure 2.  The length
   of the byte string MUST be exactly 32.

   impl-id-tagged-bytes = #6.560(arm-platform-implementation-id-type)

   arm-platform-implementation-id-type = bytes .size 32

             Figure 2: CCA Platform Implementation ID encoding

   Besides, a CCA Endorsement can be associated with a specific
   _instance_ of a certain CCA Platform implementation - as is the case
   of Attestation Verification Keys.  The Instance ID (see Section 4.4.1
   of [I-D.ffm-rats-cca-token]) provides a unique identifier for a given
   CCA Platform instance.

   To encode an Instance ID, the tagged-ueid-type variant of the
   $instance-id-type-choice is used, as described in Figure 3.  The
   first byte MUST be 0x01 (RAND) followed by the 32-byte unique
   instance identifier.

   inst-id-tagged-ueid = #6.550(eat-ueid-rand-type)

   eat-ueid-rand-type = bytes .join eat-ueid-rand-fmt

   eat-ueid-rand-fmt = [
     ; the type byte is 0x01
     ueid-rand-typ
     bytes .size 32
   ]

   ueid-rand-typ = h'01'

                Figure 3: CCA Platform Instance ID encoding

   CCA Attestation Verification Keys are associated with a CCA Platform
   instance by means of the Instance ID and the corresponding
   Implementation ID.  These identifiers are typically found in the
   subject of a CoMID triple, encoded in an environment-map as shown in
   Figure 4.

   / environment-map / {
     / comid.class / 0 : {
       / comid.class-id (implementation id) / 0 :
         / tagged-bytes / 560(
           h'61636d652d696d706c656d656e746174
             696f6e2d69642d303030303030303031'
         )
     },
     / comid.instance / 1 :
       / tagged-ueid-type (instance id) / 550(
         h'01
           4ca3e4f50bf248c39787020d68ffd05c
           88767751bf2645ca923f57a98becd296'
       )
   }

               Figure 4: Example CCA Platform Identification

   Together, they are interpreted as a unique identifier of the CCA
   Platform.

3.1.3.  Reference Values

   Reference Values carry measurements and other metadata associated
   with the updatable firmware of the CCA Platform.  CCA Platform is a
   collective term used to identify all the hardware and firmware
   components that comprise a CCA system.  Specifically these include
   the following:

   *  CCA system security domain

   *  Monitor security domain

   *  Realm Management Security domain

   When appraising Evidence, the Verifier compares Reference Values
   against:

   *  The values found in the Software Components of the CCA Platform
      token (see Section 4.6 of [I-D.ffm-rats-cca-token]).

   *  The value set in the platform configuration of the CCA Platform
      token (see Section 4.5.3 of [I-D.ffm-rats-cca-token]).

   Each measurement is encoded in a measurement-map of a CoMID
   reference-triple-record.  Since a measurement-map can encode one or
   more measurements, a single reference-triple-record can carry as many
   measurements as needed, provided they belong to the same CCA Platform
   identified in the subject of the triple.  A single reference-triple-
   record MUST completely describe the CCA Platform measurements.

3.1.3.1.  CCA Platform Software Components

   Each CCA Platform software component is encoded in a measurement-
   values-map as defined in Figure 5.

   cca-swcomp-measurement-values-map = {
     ? &(version: 0) => cca-swcomp-version-map
     &(digests: 2) => cca-swcomp-digests-type
     ? &(name: 11) => cca-swcomp-name
     &(cryptokeys: 13) => [ cca-swcomp-signer-id ]
   }

   cca-swcomp-version-map = {
     &(version: 0) => text
   }

   cca-swcomp-signer-id = #6.560(cca-hash-type)

   cca-hash-type = bytes .size 32 / bytes .size 48 / bytes .size 64

   cca-digest = [
     alg: text
     val: cca-hash-type
   ]

   cca-swcomp-digests-type = [ + cca-digest ]

   cca-swcomp-name = text

             Figure 5: CCA Platform Software Component encoding

   version (key 0):  A version-map with its version field containing the
      version (key 4) of the arm-platform-sw-component.  The version-
      scheme field of the version-map MUST NOT be present.  This field
      is optional.

   digests (key 2):  Each array element encodes the "measurement value"
      (key 2) and "hash algorithm identifier" (key 6) of the arm-
      platform-sw-component in the val and alg entries, respectively.
      The alg entry MUST use the text encoding.  The digests array MUST
      contain at least one entry and MAY contain more than one entry if
      multiple digests (obtained with different hash algorithms) of the
      same measured component exist.  If multiple entries exist, they
      MUST have different alg values.  This field is mandatory.

   name (key 11):  A text value containing the "component type" (key 1)
      of the arm-platform-sw-component.  This field is optional.

   cryptokeys (key 13):  An array with only one entry using the tagged-
      bytes variant of the $crypto-key-type-choice.  The entry contains
      the "signer id" (key 5) of the arm-platform-sw-component.  This
      field is mandatory.

   Each measurement-values-map for a CCA Platform software component is
   wrapped in a measurement-map with an mkey using the text variant of
   the $measured-element-type-choice.  The value of the mkey MUST be
   "cca.software-component".  The authorized-by field of the
   measurement-map MUST NOT be present.  Find the related CDDL
   definitions in Figure 6.

   cca-swcomp-measurement-map = {
     &(mkey: 0) => "cca.software-component"
     &(mval: 1) => cca-swcomp-measurement-values-map
   }

         Figure 6: CCA Platform Software Component measurement-map

3.1.3.2.  CCA Platform Configuration

   The CCA Platform configuration describes the set of chosen
   implementation options of the CCA Platform.  For example, this may
   include a description of the level of physical memory protection
   provided.

   CCA Platform configuration is vendor-specific variable-length data.
   Only some of the data may be security-relevant.  For these reasons,
   it is represented in a raw-value of the measurement-values-map, using
   the tagged-masked-raw-value variant of the $raw-values-type-choice.

   cca-config-measurement-values-map = {
     &(raw-value: 4) => cca-tagged-masked-raw-value
   }

   cca-config-tagged-masked-raw-value = #6.563([
     value: bytes
     mask: bytes
   ])

            Figure 7: CCA Platform Configuration measurement-map

   The measurement-values-map for a CCA Platform configuration is
   wrapped in a measurement-map with an mkey using the text variant of
   the $measured-element-type-choice.  The value of the mkey MUST be
   "cca.platform-config".  The authorized-by field of the measurement-
   map MUST NOT be present.  Find the related CDDL definitions in
   Figure 8.

   cca-config-measurement-map = {
     &(mkey: 0) => "cca.platform-config"
     &(mval: 1) => cca-config-measurement-values-map
   }

         Figure 8: CCA Platform Software Component measurement-map

   An example CoMID containing one Reference Values triple containing
   expected values for both software components and platform
   configuration is given in Figure 9.

3.1.4.  Attestation Verification Keys

   An Attestation Verification Key contains the public key associated
   with the CCA Platform Attestation Key (CPAK).  When appraising
   Platform Evidence, the Verifier uses the Implementation ID and
   Instance ID claims found in the Platform Token to identify the key
   that it shall use to verify the signature on the CCA Platform token.
   This allows the Verifier to prove (or disprove) the Attester's
   claimed identity.

   Each verification key is provided with the corresponding CCA Platform
   Instance and Implementation IDs in an attest-key-triple-record.
   Specifically:

   *  The Instance and Implementation IDs are encoded in the
      environment-map as described in Section 3.1.2;

   *  The CPAK public key uses the tagged-pkix-base64-key-type variant
      of the $crypto-key-type-choice.  The CPAK public key is a PEM-
      encoded SubjectPublicKeyInfo [RFC5280].  There MUST be only one
      key in an attest-key-triple-record.

   The example in Figure 10 shows the CCA Endorsement of type
   Attestation Verification Key carrying a secp256r1 EC public CPAK
   associated with Instance ID 4ca3...d296.

3.2.  Arm CCA Realm Endorsements

   Arm CCA Realm provides a protected execution environment for
   applications executing within a Realm.  A Realm Endorsements comprise
   of:

   *  Reference Values (Section 3.2.3), i.e., measurements of the
      configuration and contents of a Realm at the time of its
      activation along with measurements of software running inside
      Realm, which can be extended during the lifetime of a Realm.

   Please note that there are no Realm Trust Anchor Endorsements needed
   from supply chain as they are present inline in the Attestation
   Evidence.

3.2.1.  Realm Endorsements linkage to Realm

   Each Realm has a unique execution context and hence a unique Realm
   instance.  Each Realm is uniquely identified in the Arm CCA system.
   For a Realm its Endorsements are associated to this unique instance.
   The Realm instance is a vendor defined variable length identifier.
   Hence in this profile, it is represented in a CoMID inside an
   environment-map with $instance-id-type-choice set to tagged-bytes,
   i.e. an opaque, variable-length byte string.  In this profile of CCA
   Endorsements, the Realm Initial Measurements are set in tagged-bytes
   to represent Realm instance.

   When supplying Realm Endorsements, a supplier of one or more Realms
   may wish to identify itself.  Hence the following class related
   elements in the environment-map of a comid can be used.  See
   Figure 11

   In the class-map select vendor name and/or class-id set as UUID
   representing unique identity of the Realm owner.

   $class-id-type-choice /= tagged-uuid-type

3.2.2.  Arm CCA Realm Endorsement Profile

   Arm CCA Realm Endorsements are carried in a CoMID inside a CoRIM.

   The profile attribute in the CoRIM MUST be present and MUST be the
   URI tag:arm.com,2025:cca_realm#1.0.0 as shown in Figure 12.

   / corim-map / {
     / corim.profile / 3: [
       32("tag:arm.com,2025:cca_realm#1.0.0")

   }

3.2.3.  Reference Values

   Reference Values carry measurements and other metadata associated
   with the CCA Realm.

   Realm reference values comprise of:

   1.  Realm Initial Measurements (RIM)

   2.  Realm Extended Measurements (REMs)

   3.  Realm Personalization Value (RPV)

   RIM and REMs are encoded in a measurement-values-map (in a
   measurement-map) of a CoMID reference-triple-record.  Inside
   measurement-values-map these measurements are carried as integrity-
   registers map.  Integrity Registers map is used to group together one
   or more measured objects pertaining to an environment.  Please refer
   to [I-D.ietf-rats-corim] for details about Integrity Register map.

   All the measured objects in an Integrity Registers map are explicitly
   named.  In the context of Realms, the measured objects are RIM and
   REMs.  Inside Integrity Register map, RIM is uniquely identified by
   the name "rim", while REMs which is an array of measurements from
   1..4 are uniquely identified by the coresponding name "rem0".."rem3".

   Realm Personalization Value, (RPV) is an optional identity used by a
   Realm endorser to uniquely identify multiple Realms which all have
   the same RIM.  RPV if provided is a fixed length 64 bytes identifier.
   In this profile, RPV is represented using Raw Value Measurements in a
   measurement-values-map, with raw value type choice set to tagged-
   bytes.  See Figure 13

   $raw-value-type-choice /= tagged-bytes
